# Skills Collection

A collection of reusable skills for AI coding agents.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your home directory:

```bash
cd ~
git clone <repo-url> .skills
```

2. Run the setup script to automatically link skills to detected agents:

```bash
~/.skills/setup.sh
```

The script detects installed agents (`.claude`, `.codex`, `.opencode`) and creates symlinks automatically.
